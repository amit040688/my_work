          <!-- Those days we were a tiny player looking for a way to differentiate
        ourselves — to serve business customers better than the big IT
        consultancy companies and other competitors did. So, we hired smart
        people who were deeply committed to serving customers. We began
        providing end-to-end customer service and branded it UPSALA Support®.
        We developed specialized expertise in technologies to have a proﬁcient
        understanding of front-end development, back-end development, and 256
        encrypt databases. We also have a better understanding of Linux,
        Windows, and network security to provide the best managed hosting
        service in the industry. And as more and more customers recommended
        us, we quickly came to lead that industry. Fast forward to 2014,now
        enterprises could access and use the public cloud, and developers
        suddenly had access to vast computing resources and could rent them.
        But, to use it, a business had to hire experts in cloud infrastructure
        and the many complex tools, applications and databases that run on top
        of it. Today, UPSALA DEFSOL AND IT SERVICES PRIVATE LIMITED is a
        leading provider of expertise and manage Artificial Intelligence&
        Drone Solutions across all the major Defense Sector, also manage
        across all the public and private cloud technologies. Passionate
        experts combine the power of proactive, always-on service and
        expertise with best-in-class tools and automation to deliver
        technology when and how you need it. -->
          In the early days, we were a scrappy startup determined to stand out.
          We knew we couldn't compete with the IT giants on size, so we focused
          on agility and exceptional customer service. We recruited brilliant
          minds who were obsessed with delighting our clients. This led to the
          creation of UPSALA Support®, our end-to-end customer service model. We
          honed our technical expertise, becoming fluent in the languages of
          front-end and back-end development, wielding 256 encryption databases
          like second nature. We mastered the intricacies of Linux, Windows, and
          network security, all in pursuit of crafting the industry's most
          robust managed hosting service. Client recommendations fueled our
          growth, propelling us to the forefront of the industry. Fast forward
          to 2014, the cloud revolution arrived. Businesses gained access to
          vast, on-demand computing resources. But to leverage this new power,
          they needed cloud infrastructure gurus – individuals who could
          navigate the complex landscape of tools, applications, and databases
          that resided within. Today, UPSALA DEFSOL AND IT SERVICES PRIVATE
          LIMITED stands as a leading innovator, providing cutting-edge
          expertise and management solutions in Artificial Intelligence and
          Drone Technology across the entire defense sector. We are equally
          adept at managing public and private cloud technologies. Our team of
          passionate experts blends proactive, 24/7 service with best-in-class
          automation tools, ensuring you receive the technology you need,
          exactly when you need it.
